            <p class="pTalent">Most parents don't know the true talents of their children, so the usual modus
                operandi would be to go on a trial and error system of putting their children into different
                types of talent classes until they could hit one that they think would suit them. Unfortunately,
                this has been deemed ineffective in maximizing the potential of your children. With knowledge
                comes power. Planning for our children's education has never been this efficient and 
                cost-effective before.</p>

            <h1 class="dHeading">DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TEST</h1>

            <p class="pDisease"> Pre-emptive capabilities means earlier detection and better treatment options. By providing insights into your genes through genetic testing,
                you can take action-steps towards a healthier and longer life. Innate genetic risks, when 
                coupled with environmental factors, renders one prone to developing diseases early in life.
                Prevention is always better than cure. Genetic testing enables us to identify our genetic risks 
                early and take right steps to protect our health. Prevention can become much more effective when we are given 
                the know-how through genetic knowledge.
