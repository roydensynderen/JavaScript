                <p>I was able to learn programming languages that allows me to build and style websites. I am currently trying to create a blog that looks representable for this CSS exercise.</p>

                <p>Peru was fun! I got to climb the rainbow mountain, machu picchu, humantay lake, and cuddle with baby alpacas! I highly recommend going to Peru if one likes hiking, and I am sure that you will have a load
                     of fun!</p>

                <p>Alaska was freezing cold! As one who hates extreme cold, Alaksa trip was indeed less enjoyable as compared to all the other trips I went. However, we managed to catch the Northern lights which made the trip 
                    worthwhile! I had a frost nip just by sitting on the dog sled. Thank God my ear did not drop off.  Never going back to Alaska again.</p>
