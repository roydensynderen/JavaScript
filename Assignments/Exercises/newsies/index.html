        <p>PRESIDENT TRUMP has set in motion one of his most controverial campaign promises, calling on Congress to fund a "massive deportation force" by tripling the number of federal
                Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p>
        <p>The president made the announcementin a nationally televised adress last night from the Old Post Office building in Washington, .C., now a Trump International Hotel. In a
                surprise move after the speech, Trump invited Attorney General Chris Christie to stand right next to him at the podium to field questions. "#no_side_eye for Christie this time,"
                tweeted Fox News Channel reporter Megyn Kelly, who was covering the speech from a sports bar near Rockefeller Center because she has been placed on a White House blacklist.
        <p>Although Trump reiterated his promise to eject some 11.3 million illegal workers on a two-year timetable - "so fast that your head will spin" - he also promised to "do it humanely."
                He did not immediately offer details but said he intends to flesh out the policy with special adviser George Papadopoulos, just as soon as the 2009 college grat returns from a 
                preplanned Model UN session in Geneva. The $400 billion deportation program promises to be one of the most disruptive government actions attempted since desegregation.
                Economists estimate ICE would need more than 900,000 agents to complete the deportations in the next two years. Thousands of protesters remain camped outside the Trump
                International Hotel and around the fence of the White House. Singing and chanting have been audible inside the executive mansion day and night for weeks. The scent of
                tear gas pervades Lafayette Square. After Trump vowed to strip federal funding from santuary cities during his campaign, round-the-clock protests in Cambridge, Mass.,
                shit down the Red Line temporarily, forcing scores of at­ tendees at an elite Harvard/MIT tech­ fest to evacuate Kendall Square and
                take the MBTA’s #1 Bus across the Charles River to an alternate site in Boston.
                Already in California, armed ICE agents confronted 30 illegal strawber­ ry pickers on a Santa Barbara County farm and bused them to a detention center to await prosecution 
                and a gov­ ernment­chartered flight back to Mex­ ico. State officials held a press confer­ ence shortly after the raid to express concern about the economic impact if 
                “dishes go unwashed in the kitchens of San Francisco restaurants and if our $3 billion strawberry crop is ulti­ mately left to rot.”
                Trump downplayed fears that the deportations would hurt industries that rely on illegal workers. “Don’t forget...you have millions of people that are waiting in line
                to come into this country, and they're waiting to come in legally.</p>

        <p>WORLDWIDE STOCKS plunged again Friday, completing the worst month on record as trade wars with both China and Mexico seem imminent. Markets from the Dow to the FTSE
                        to the Nikkei have sunk on speculation that China is dumping some of its US Treasury holdings after the Trump administration announced tarriffs as high as 45 percent for
                        all Chinese imports and 35 percent for some Mexican goods. "I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year," the president said last year. But Chinese
                        officials have made it no secret that they will not let tarrifs go unanswered. The Asian giant is the largest holder of US debt, owning some $1.4 trillion worth, according
                        to Federal Reserve figures.</p>
